Radio-Hauraki
=============

Small script to play radio hauraki while muting in the ads

Note you must have mpg123 installed. If you don't then substitute it for another command line mp3 player.

Make sure 'hauraki' and 'hauraki-noads' are executable

& run it from bash like this "hauraki |& hauraki-noads"
